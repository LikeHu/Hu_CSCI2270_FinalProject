The summary description for final project:
Five in a row！
Welcome to Like's Five in a row game! This is one of Chinese traditional "Black and White chess game." Also called Gobang, it is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board with 15x15 intersections; However, because once placed, pieces are not moved or removed from the board; It may also be played as a paper and pencil game. This game is known in several countries under different names. Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
